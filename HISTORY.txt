    (name of developer listed in brackets)

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.0 beta 2 [2010.03.04]

    - No longer throws an error on ipn verification for a payment_status other 
      than 'Completed', since returning http status codes other than 200 can
      result in Paypal disabling IPN notfications altogether. One implication
      of this change is that refunds now also create Leads, but with a
      negative payment value.
