    (name of developer listed in brackets)

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.3 [2014.11.17]

    - Remove timezone identifier from PayPal payment date string
    before converting to date for Salesforce.  Avoid problems from
    OS-level differences in implementation of strptime.

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.2.1 [2014.11.11]

    - declare namespace for Products namespace package
    [bryanlandia]

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.2 [2014.11.07]

    - Create an additional property use_salesforce_sandbox and change
    the URL for web2lead form if using sandbox.
    Previous versions checked for specific HTML in response string
    from SF web2lead form, which has since changed.  Validate based
    on presence or not of 'is-processed' response header instead.
    Intuitively, 'is-processed' will be sent if there is an error.
    Product should really be updated to use a solid API insted of old
    web2lead form.
    Update tests accordingly.
    PEP8 fixes.
    Update TODO, CONTRIBUTORS

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.1 [2014.11.07]

    - Eggify the Product.
    Fix paypal2lead's date conversion to match changed format sent by PayPal.
    Bump version to 1.1
    [bryanlandia]

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.0 beta 3 [2011.02.10]

    - In general aim to catch exceptions, log errors, and return a 200 status
      code rather than returning 500 errors, in order to prevent disabling IPN 
      notifications.

Paypal2SalesforceLead 1.0 beta 2 [2010.03.04]

    - No longer throws an error on ipn verification for a payment_status other 
      than 'Completed', since returning http status codes other than 200 can
      result in Paypal disabling IPN notfications altogether. One implication
      of this change is that refunds now also create Leads, but with a
      negative payment value.
